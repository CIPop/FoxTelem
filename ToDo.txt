FoxTelem
~~~~~~~~
Release 1.02
Bug where T0 not downloaded into currentDir
Crash where T0 not displayed on the diagnostic tables
Added horizontal and vertical lines to the tables

Merge HERCI into 1.03 perhaps after extensive regression testing


FoxServer
~~~~~~~~~
We still get timeouts on the server.  The log suggests that we should set autoRetry on the java connection

The FoxService crashes or stops working. Unclear why. Needs better error handing.  
It is probablly the same timeout issue though....

Add number of files processed today and number of exceptions to the leaderboard page.
Add a BANNER if ALERT raised to indicate that the admins have been paged!

The start scripts needs to restart the server if it crashes
I need to send email (or better text) alerts if there is an error - write a java function for
cricital errors or dectect when crash or hung..

Send email to text using
T-Mobile: phonenumber@tmomail.net
where number is 10 digits

Use javaMail api - download:
