1.01
 * Send the frames to both primary and secondary server
 * Set the default fcd frequency to 145930 so that Fox-1A, Fox-1Cliff and Fox-1D will be in the passband
 * Allow user to select UDP or TCP for upload to the server and save in settings
 * Shorten the period between passes so that graphs look continuous
 * Ignore duplicate high speed radiation frames - needed for processing data from the server
 * Do not change the FCD LNA or Mixer Gain.  Leave unchanged.
 * Allow graphs to be hidden so that average or deriv is easier to see
 * Switch the server protocol instantly when it is saved from settings screen (rather than requiring a restart)
 * Fixed a bug where the last 2 bytes of the radiation telemetry were not decoded correctly
 * Allow Vanderbilt radiation experiment to be graphed
 * Allow the gain to be set on the FCD (rather than hard coded)
 * Notify the user when a new release is available
